# Response to Apple Review - Guideline 2.3.3 (iPad Screenshots)

## To Apple App Review Team:

Thank you for your feedback regarding the iPad screenshots.

### Issue Acknowledged

We understand that the current iPad screenshots do not accurately represent the app's appearance on iPad devices. We have taken new, authentic screenshots directly from an iPad Air 11-inch (M3) device running iPadOS 26.2.

### Actions Taken

1. **Captured Authentic iPad Screenshots**: All iPad screenshots have been retaken using the iPad Air 11-inch (M3) simulator, showing the actual app interface as it appears on iPad
2. **Verified Device-Specific UI**: Confirmed that the screenshots show the full-width layout, proper aspect ratios, and iPad-optimized interface
3. **Updated App Store Connect**: Uploaded new iPad screenshots showing all main features:
   - Music section with playlist view
   - Fun (Entertainment) section with video player
   - Football highlights section
   - Profile and authentication screens

### Screenshot Details

All screenshots now accurately reflect:
- ✅ Correct iPad aspect ratio (13-inch iPad Pro: 2048x2732)
- ✅ Native iPad interface (not stretched iPhone screenshots)
- ✅ Full app functionality in use
- ✅ Main features clearly visible

The updated screenshots have been uploaded to App Store Connect under "View All Sizes in Media Manager".

### Request

We respectfully request a new review with the corrected iPad screenshots.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
LinusPlaylists Development Team
